    "We have been working this semester on educational modules for the <a href="https://www.powderwireless.net/cyberpowder2026">2026 CyberPowder Fellows Program</a>. The program has one (virtual) meeting each week, combining a lecture + lab + homework assignment, on experimental wireless topics including the radio channel, communications, networking, and spectrum sharing.
    
    We've just finished a round of updating and improving three such modules (lecture + lab + homework). We want to share them with other wireless instructors and students who might be looking for new learning material. The tutorials are designed to be self-contained. You can use POWDER to run an experiment and record your own data. Or you can use recorded data we have provided to develop and test receiver code. In sum, there's a lot of online lecture material (recordings, readings, and slides), tutorials, and homework assignments, and you're welcome to use whatever you would like in your self-study or in your class.
    
    1. **Radio channels**: *Antennas, signals, path loss, channels, multipath*. <a href="https://github.com/npatwari/pathLossLargeGroupTutorial/blob/main/POWDER-Lecture-Channels.pdf">Lecture Notes</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rluhSdhnIg_Hh9XQQi1qkP7EuzdhZhlOScvlfsSxjGA/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>. Before class, students read <a href="https://5g.systemsapproach.org/radio.html">P5G-SAa Chapter 3 Intro and 3.1</a> and watch 5 videos in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQuDEk4rPDONcXztQTGeNkGqI1Loq_QmN">this playlist</a>: 1) <a href="https://youtu.be/5sQN29WuOZ8">Signals, Power, and Energy</a> (7:10); 2) <a href="https://youtu.be/Mpu00WRJ29g">I'm Adding dB to this Course</a> (10:45); 3) <a href="https://youtu.be/0xQ7FgC-ysE">Received Power Models</a> (15:59); 4) <a href="https://youtu.be/5DTwxr526Vg">Why do Bad Fades Happen to Good Channels?</a> (6:43); 5) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IqDdhbZy1g">6 Things About Antennas</a> (4:32). During class they do a hands-on lab on <a href="https://github.com/npatwari/pathLossLargeGroupTutorial">Path Loss Measurement using the Shout Framework</a> during which they send and receive CW signals over the air on the POWDER testbed. They are assigned the homework described at the end of the python notebook in that lab.
    2. **Digital Communications**: *Modulation & Demodulation, QAM / PSK*. Before class, students read <a href="https://github.com/npatwari/QPSK-RX-Tutorial/blob/main/POWDER-Lecture-Modulation.pdf">lecture notes</a> and watch 3-7 videos: (optional videos for those unfamiliar with digital communications): <a href="https://youtu.be/8Jo8q-tm-Js">Why Study Orthogonality?</a> (5:33); (optional) <a href="https://youtu.be/78x22sDBDzY">Orthogonality Definition and Examples</a> (9:09); (optional) <a href="https://youtu.be/3yBBMEmAtow">How do we transmit data with an orthonormal basis?</a> (12:50); (optional) <a href="https://youtu.be/J14N9jKBKCU">How do we receive bits using an orthogonal basis?</a> (10:20); (optional) <a href="https://youtu.be/xxFlC7cenTU">We Actually Use Convolution Instead of Correlation</a> (4:20); <a href="https://youtu.be/mV4-Vq6ZgfA">How SRRC Pulses are Used at a PAM Transmitter and Receiver</a> (8:55); <a href="https://youtu.be/WyGYwbeBazQ">What Time Domain Signal is Sent in QAM?</a> (7:45). During class they get <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GEvuv55MQevgGRI_9YsfqYssVL4aelzh6mQM8t49etw/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p">a QPSK lab introduction</a> and do a Colab-based <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kZpE463lQY_a00LUP1zraB6TqPxrQmaG?usp=sharing">hands-on lab to build a QPSK receiver</a>, and run it on a signal we collected OTA on the POWDER wireless testbed. Then they are assigned a homework to build a 16-QAM receiver.
    3. **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**: *Motivation, transmitter and receiver design*. Students watch 2 videos before class: <a href="https://youtu.be/JGgcD7Js0zs">What is OFDM? Subcarriers Shift and Pulse Shape</a> (5:28); <a href="https://youtu.be/f4dXe1G23cc">How OFDM Got its FFT</a> (8:55).

The paper proposes and tests an online learning algorithm to convert frequency-modulatated carrier wave (FMCW) radar and inertial measurements to a prediction of an impending collision. Inertial measurements are used to label collitions after they happen and automatically label data for future model improvements. The methods could allow future smart helmets, like used for American football, to react to collisions before they happen, and thus reduce the severity of the impact.

    Our "Racial disparities in pulse oximetry can't be fixed with race-based correction" paper is being presented at the <a href="https://chase23.sigbed.org/">8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE 2023) conference</a> on June 23, 2023. The paper uses a large data set of pulse oximeter (SpO2) measurements and (ground truth) lab arterial oxygenation measurements to evaluate the error variance of SpO2 as a function of patient racial group. The data shows that error variance is significantly higher for patients racialized as Black and Asian, and the paper discusses potential reasons for this higher variance. Researchers have suggested race-based correction of SpO2, i.e., subtracting their known bias as a function of race.  But our paper shows that this is not sufficient to close the gap in the performance of detecting hypoxemia from SpO2 measurements.

    Announcing "Racial disparities in pulse oximetry can't be fixed with race-based correction", a new paper co-authored by Neal Patwari, Di Huang, and Kiki Bonetta-Misteli! It is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04990">posted on arXiv</a> today.  We followed the famous Sjoding et al. paper on <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029240">Racial bias in pulse oximetry measurement</a>, and used the <a href="https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/">eICU database</a> to evaluate hypoxemia detection disparities. There are disparities in pulse ox measurement variance and distribution shape, which lead any realistic hypoxemia detector to have discriminatory results.  To be clear, the cause of this difference - not fixing the design of the pulse ox in the more than 25 years since the disparity was first published - is racism. We argue for fixing the pulse oximeter, not a correction factor.

First, Greg Hellbourg (Caltech), Ning Zhang (WashU) and Neal Patwari have been awarded an NSF SWIFT grant on “Closing the Loop for Accountable Interference-free Spectrum Sharing with Passive Radio Receivers”.  We’ll be <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2229427">working on methods to share spectrum reliably</a> when some of the users are passive radio users, like radio telescopes, by providing new feedback & accountability mechanisms.  Secondly, we found out that the POWDER team, led by Kobus Van der Merwe (U. of Utah), several other investigators at the University of Utah, and Gregory Durgin (Ga Tech) and Neal Patwari, have been awarded an NSF "SII-NRDZ" grant called "POWDER-RDZ - Spectrum sharing in the POWDER platform". This award will <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2232464">build tools to build a "radio dynamic zone" (RDZ)</a> in Salt Lake City Utah and test new measurement and modeling technologies that can protect spectrum users outside of the zone from interfering signals originating inside of the zone.

    We have posted our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01157">work that quantifies nationality bias in English-language automatic speech recognition (ASR) services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft</a>.  One would hope that English-language ASR services would perform equally for the many Englishes spoken around the world.  But as we show, popular ASR services perform best on English spoken by people born in the US.  Moreover, ASR performance is better for people born in nations aligned with US geopolitical power.  We show that, even controlling for multiple covariates (English as a first language, speaker born in the US, first language in Germanic family, age of onset, sex), English speakers not born in a NATO country experience significantly worse performance from major ASR services.  The implication is that people with equal experience speaking English are going to have different abilities of accessing ASR-based services (e.g., voice control of "smart" devices, automatic transcription) based purely on where they were born. Alex DiChristofano (in the Computational & Data Sciences PhD program), started this work as a class project in "Equity and Fairness in Estimation and Classification" (CSE 544A), and continued to develop the work into this paper.

  description: >
    Why have inequities persisted for so long, despite years of activism, education, policy changes, and society’s stated values of equity and non-discrimination? The answer, in our view, is rooted in the phenomenon of feedback. In every system in which inequity persists over time, there are feedback mechanisms which enable it to survive. Our paper argues that feedback modeling tools from systems theory are helpful in quantitatively modeling mechanisms of feedback: proportional, integral, and derivative (PID), that help perpetuate or combat inequity.  We give several examples of each of these PID types of feedback in societal systems of inequity.  Using this framework, we present a mathematical model to help quantify the impact of these types of feedback in real-world systems. We also explore how this model can be used to inform policies to generate equity and combat historical injustice. Progress is not inevitable and the impacts of injustice do not simply disappear. We hope that with good models and with better people, we can work to make fairness last for everyone. Our FAccT 2022 paper: <a href="https://facctconference.org/static/pdfs_2022/facct22-141.pdf">Models for understanding and quantifying feedback in societal systems</a>, is being presented by Lydia Reader at The 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), on Friday, June 23, in Seoul.

  pubDate: "Tue, 22 Dec 2020"
  description: >
    We're announcing today our work (led by Dr. Alemayehu Solomon Abrar) to expose just how well an adversary could eavesdrop if they have access to a wireless device near you.  Prior work [Wei 2015] has shown that WiFi receivers can be used to eavesdrop on audio through walls using measurements of channel state information (CSI).  This can be a huge threat to privacy because a WiFi interface, not a microphone or other sensor, can be used to record audio.  It was believed that this was limited to WiFi because of its access to CSI measurements across multiple antennas, essentially hundreds of dimensions of data on the vibrations at each received WiFi packet.  As we had suspected, even a single antenna single channel receiver that only measures quantized dB received power can be used to eavesdrop. People assume that the quantization provides a level of security, because power is typically quantized to the nearest 1 dB, which is much (~100x) bigger than the changes caused by audio vibrations.  However, it is known that extra noise can sometimes help with estimation.  Dr. Abrar showed that this is a feasible for an attacker: add noise via interfering transmitters, and then improve the estimates of the amplitude and frequency of the sound.  His work, <a href="https://patwarilab.com/pub/abrar2020quantifying.pdf">Quantifying Interference-Assisted Signal Strength Surveillance of Sound Vibrations</a>, which has now appeared in the <i>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</i>, goes beyond demonstrating this attack to bound an interferer's capabilities, allowing the designer of the transceiver IC to limit the the quantization and frequency of received power measurements so that an eavesdropper could have little success.  We hope that by limiting availability to the measurement we can disable this potential for eavesdropping.

Besides enabling a simpler deployment, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the anchor-free distributed algorithm can outperform both coordinate-based and pairwise collision prediction methods.

The system uses pairwise ultra-wideband (UWB) measurements to repeatedly measure the range between the two objects.  The method extrapolates a few 100 ms into the future based on a parabolic fit of the squared distance over time.  If the extrapolation shows the two will soon be within a threshold distance of each other, it detects an impending collision.  More detail is available in <a href="https://patwarilab.com/pub/abrar2020demo.pdf">the abstract</a>.  In the video, the microcontroller turns on an LED.  This demo is part of the <a href="https://ipsn.acm.org/2020/posters.html?v=1">IPSN 2020 poster and demo session</a>. Congrats to Jonathan and Alemayehu for their completed project.

  title: "Powder REU Projects"

  description: >
     We are recruiting undergraduate researchers to participate in an NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project during Summer 2020 at Washington University in St. Louis.  There are two paid full-time REU positions this summer, both working to develop tools for the Powder wireless platform. <a href="https://powderwireless.net/">Powder</a> enables repeatable experimentation to a degree that has been previously unattainable by researchers.  However, wireless performance is also a function of the real world, for example, weather, season, interference from other wireless systems, exact position of mobile devices, and clock differences at the particular time at which an experiment is run.  Thus another researcher may see different results than the original research.  
     <p>These REU projects will capture meta-data about the conditions of the Powder platform, the devices in the network, and the environment in which an experiment is run, in order to provide a means to be able to debug, after the fact, how different the experimental conditions were compared to those recorded during a prior experiment.  We will develop software tools that can be included in experiments with little set up or overhead from the user.  These tools will be designed to collect metadata, save the metadata, and to compare and visualize the differences between two sets of metadata.  Three categories of these metadata are:</p>
     <ul> <li>Time / clock synchronization: capturing changes in clock offsets between different SDRs in the network</li> <li>Interference power: capturing changes in the noise plus interference power observed at receivers in the network</li> <li>Channel changes: sounding the radio channel using devices alternately as transmitters and receivers to monitor the radio channel for changes in received power that might be attributed to changes in the environment or weather</li> </ul>
     <p>The REU projects will pick some metadata to monitor, determine ways of capturing it during, before and after experiments, and write and test the software tools.  For some of these objectives, we will need to come up with creative ways to accurately capture this data to meet the constraints and limitations of the system.</p>
     <p>Monitoring such metadata with these tools and observing its impact on other research, is a particularly interesting avenue of research that may lead to publication.  Thus writing about the results of the project is also an important task for the REU.  </p>
     <p>The Powder platform is physically deployed in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we will be working with collaborators and other REU students at the University of Utah and at Rice University.  The internship may include one week-long trip to Salt Lake City for in-person work and tutorials at the University of Utah; if so travel expenses will be paid from the REU funding.</p>
     <p>REU participants will be developing software in Python. Other skills of use are: radio wave propagation, statistical signal processing, software radio (particularly GNU Radio), general Linux familiarity. </p>
     <p>To apply, send your CV/resume, transcript, and the names and email addresses of two references to Neal Patwari, first initial lastname @wustl.edu.</p>

    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ossikaltiokallio/">Ossi Kaltiokallio</a> will give a seminar at the ESE Department on Thursday 9 January, 2020, at 9am in the Rodin Auditorium.   <p>Title: RF Sensing and Device-free Localization for Aging in Place</p>  <p>Seminar Abstract: In developed nations, the demographic change in the population is creating many challenges both from a societal and an economic standpoint. Research into aging, age-related conditions, and the means to support an aging population has therefore become a priority for many governments around the world. The aim is to develop both preventive and monitoring systems for aging well at home, in the community, and at work. Radio frequency (RF) sensing is particularly suitable for realizing such monitoring systems because the technology is passive and does not require users to carry obtrusive and uncomfortable sensors, and the technology is suitable for a wide range of monitoring purposes. The focus of this talk is on received signal strength-based device-free localization, which is a subtopic of RF sensing.</p>

      Riku Jäntti returns to the SPAN Lab on 13 May 2019.  He will present a seminar on 'Localization in 5G Ultra–Dense Networks', 3-4 pm on Monday May 13, in Brauer Hall, Room 12.  He is is a Full Professor of Communications Engineering and the head of the department of Communications and Networking at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland. He received his M.Sc (with distinction) in Electrical Engineering in 1997 and D.Sc (with distinction) in Automation and Systems Technology in 2001, both from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK). Prior to joining Aalto (formerly known as TKK) in August 2006, he was professor pro tem at the Department of Computer Science, University of Vaasa. Prof. Jäntti is a senior member of IEEE and associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. He was also IEEE VTS Distinguished Lecturer (Class 2016). The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud-based Radio Access Networks, spectrum and co-existence management, and quantum communications.  Prof. Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Cellular systems are undergoing a transformation towards the fifth generation (5G). Envisioned applications in 5G include intelligent transport system (ITS), autonomous vehicles and robots as part of future roads, factories and society. These applications rely to a great extent on accurate and timely location information of connected devices. This talk proposes a practical scheme for acquiring precise and timely position information by means of a user–centric ultra–dense network (UDN) architecture based on an edge cloud. The considered solution consists of estimating and tracking the azimuth angle–of–arrival (AoA) of the line–of–sight (LoS)–path between a device and multiple transmission–reception points (TRPs), each having a uniform linear antenna array (ULA). AoA estimates from multiple TRPs are fused into position estimates at the edge cloud to obtain timely position information. Extensive measurements have been carried out using a proof–of–concept software–defined–radio (SDR) testbed in order to experimentally assess the achievable positioning accuracy of the proposed architecture. A realistic UDN deployment scenario has been considered in which TRPs consist of antenna arrays mounted on lamp posts. Our results show that practical UDNs can provide sub–meter positioning accuracy of mobile users by employing ULAs with at least four antennas per TRP as well as by taking into account the non–idealities of the ULAs’ phase and magnitude response.

You will need a computer and headset to join the web conference.  This course presents the state-of-the-art in using commercial wireless devices to make radio frequency (RF) channel measurements and sense the state of the environment. RF sensing is used to locate and track people in the vicinity of the RF sensors, to monitor their breathing and pulse rate, to perform gesture and activity recognition, and other applications.  These are often called "device free" sensing because the person being monitored does not carry any device on them, instead, we sense the changes from static deployed wireless network.  This course presents the fundamentals, the statistical models, and the algorithms used in RF sensing.  Students will borrow RF sensors for the semester and implement algorithms that run in real time on the data from their sensors.  We will discuss the most recent research papers in the area via web conference.  Students will implement and improve RF sensing algorithms and be graded in part on their accuracy.  Students will also complete and present a course project to implement or analyze a RF sensing system.

The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control  and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud based Radio Access Networks,  spectrum and co-existence management, quantum communictions and RF Inference.  Riku Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Low power wireless communications has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT).  The performance of the contemporary IoT connectivity solutions are mainly limited by congestion, interference, and limited operation time with battery. These limitations hampers the scaling of the IoT deployments. The first part of the talk discuss Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity solution that combines existing and emerging wireless communication systems, with a new layer of ultra-low-power or passive ambient backscatter communications (AmBC). An AmBC deice modulates the ambient signal impinging at its antenna. In contrast to traditional systems, AmBC devices do not need a power-hungry transceiver and can achieve up to 1000 times lower power consumption  and 10 to 100 times lower device cost than contemporary active-transceiver-based solutions. The second part of talk, discuss the possibility of using quantum radar technology to improve the performance of backscatter communications beyond the limits of classical systems. The proposed quantum backscatter system utilizes microwave quantum illumination to improve the receiver performance. The communication device, the backscatter tag, is still a classical one. All the complexity is put on the transceiver side.

      The NSF has funded our research project "Advanced Radio Frequency (RF)-based Environmental Monitoring Systems" to be performed collaboratively at Georgia Tech and the University of Utah.  Prof. <a href="https://span.ece.utah.edu/neal-patwari">Neal Patwari</a> and the SPAN lab will conduct the research at the University of Utah, and Prof. <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff/fac_profiles/bio.php?id=35">Gregory D. Durgin</a> and the <a href="https://www.propagation.gatech.edu/index.htm">Propagation Lab</a> will conduct the research at Georgia Tech.  The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1407949&HistoricalAwards=false">award</a> is an investigation in the science of temporal fading as it is useful for new radio frequency (RF) environmental monitoring (REM) systems.  Research in this project considers temporal fading and seeks to establish how it is affected by the movements of people in the environment so that it can be exploited for environmental monitoring.

      Merrick McCracken presents his paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1418v1">Joint ultra-wideband and signal strength-based through-building tracking for tactical operations</a>, at the 2013 IEEE Intl. Conf. on Sensing, Communications, and Networking, on Wednesday, June 26, in New Orleans.  His paper, co-authored by Maurizio Bocca and Neal Patwari, explores combining ultra-wideband impulse radar with radio tomography in order to achieve accurate localization without having sensors on all sides of an area to be covered.  The idea is particularly motivated by emergency response applications.
