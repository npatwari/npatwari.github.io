      We're excited to announce that at CPS-IoT Week 2019, we will hold the <a href="http://dflcompetition.org/">Bosch Device-Free Localization Competition</a>!  This is a first-of-its-kind event designed to allow DFL systems to be compared side by side in a single evaluation environment.  While DFL has not had past competitions, device localization has been the subject of several years of competition at the IPSN conference through the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/microsoft-indoor-localization-competition-ipsn-2018/">Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition</a>.  Four winning teams will walk away with cash prizes.  We urge researchers interested in participating to read about the competition, submit an abstract, build their DFL system, and bring it to the conference and compete!

      Neal Patwari will teach a class via web conference this semester on "RF Sensing".  UofU students can sign up for ECE 6960-013.  Non UofU students can participate by sending an email to Neal and request enrollment.  The course is Tue and Thu 12:25 - 1:45pm (MT).  This course meets via <a href="https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari">web conference<a>: <a href="https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari">https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari</a>.  You will need a computer and headset to join the web conference.  This course presents the state-of-the-art in using commercial wireless devices to make radio frequency (RF) channel measurements and sense the state of the environment. RF sensing is used to locate and track people in the vicinity of the RF sensors, to monitor their breathing and pulse rate, to perform gesture and activity recognition, and other applications.  These are often called "device free" sensing because the person being monitored does not carry any device on them, instead, we sense the changes from static deployed wireless network.  This course presents the fundamentals, the statistical models, and the algorithms used in RF sensing.  Students will borrow RF sensors for the semester and implement algorithms that run in real time on the data from their sensors.  We will discuss the most recent research papers in the area via web conference.  Students will implement and improve RF sensing algorithms and be graded in part on their accuracy.  Students will also complete and present a course project to implement or analyze a RF sensing system.

      The SPAN lab has been working as part of an interdisciplinary team across campus on the "Pediatric Research Using Integrated Sensor Monitoring" project funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering to develop new sensor networking tools for epidemiologists.  Over the past two and a half years, we've been developing networking software, air quality sensors, and tools that aid in deployment, monitoring, and visualization, for the specific needs of epidemilogists who want to put sensors in study participants' homes to better know their exposure to air pollution and other asthma triggers.  The end goal is to allow people to reduce their exposure to pollutants that might affect their long-term or immediate health.  Philip Lundrigan, a PhD student at the U, has authored a paper that will be presented at the IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications (SenseApp 2018) on 1 Oct. 2018, which discusses the EpiFi system of which he has led the development.

      Riku Jäntti will present a seminar on 'Ambient and Quantum Backscatter Communications', 1-2 pm on Wednesday June 13, in room MEB 2109.  He is is an Associate Professor (tenured) in Communications Engineering and the head of the department of Communications and Networking at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland. He received his M.Sc (with distinction) in Electrical Engineering in 1997 and D.Sc (with distinction) in Automation and Systems Technology in 2001, both from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK). Prior to joining Aalto (formerly known as TKK) in August 2006, he was professor pro tem at the Department of Computer Science, University of Vaasa. Prof. Jäntti is a senior member of IEEE and associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. He is also IEEE VTS Distinguished Lecturer (Class 2016). The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control  and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud based Radio Access Networks,  spectrum and co-existence management, quantum communictions and RF Inference.  Riku Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Low power wireless communications has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT).  The performance of the contemporary IoT connectivity solutions are mainly limited by congestion, interference, and limited operation time with battery. These limitations hampers the scaling of the IoT deployments. The first part of the talk discuss Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity solution that combines existing and emerging wireless communication systems, with a new layer of ultra-low-power or passive ambient backscatter communications (AmBC). An AmBC deice modulates the ambient signal impinging at its antenna. In contrast to traditional systems, AmBC devices do not need a power-hungry transceiver and can achieve up to 1000 times lower power consumption  and 10 to 100 times lower device cost than contemporary active-transceiver-based solutions. The second part of talk, discuss the possibility of using quantum radar technology to improve the performance of backscatter communications beyond the limits of classical systems. The proposed quantum backscatter system utilizes microwave quantum illumination to improve the receiver performance. The communication device, the backscatter tag, is still a classical one. All the complexity is put on the transceiver side.

       In deployments of WiFi devices for smart home applications, the time required for passing home WiFi authentication information to each device is long and is proportional to the number of sensors being deployed.  Deployers could save significant time and avoid problems with Philip Lundrigan's new <a href="http://span.ece.utah.edu/pub/STRAP_camera_ready.pdf">secure transfer of association protocol" (STRAP)</a>, which sends authentication information to all devices simultaneously in a secure and novel manner.
