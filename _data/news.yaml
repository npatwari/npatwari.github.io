     We've just posted on arXiv a pre-print of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04313.pdf">work by Dr. Alemayehu Solomon Abrar on the FACT collision prediction system</a>, with which we enable a distributed group of mobile nodes to predict an impending collision without any anchors (known location nodes), purely using their recent ultra-wideband range measurements between themselves.  Besides enabling a simpler deployment, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the anchor-free distributed algorithm can outperform both coordinate-based and pairwise collision prediction methods.

     We are happy to announce that we'll be working on a new funded project from the NSF called "Using the POWDER Platform to Explore the Feasibility of NRDZs".  We will be developing technologies to enable future <a href="https://www.doncio.navy.mil/CHIPS/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=10299">national radio dynamic zones</a> (NRDZs).  These NRDZs could enable more dynamic spectrum assignment in particular geographical areas, and spur faster implementation of new wireless technologies and services.  Our project will develop technologies to enable such zones with monitoring, measurement, and modeling systems which ensure that the new spectrum use in the NRDZ doesn't interfere with other systems outside of the NRDZ.  We will be collaborating with <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/">Kobus Van der Merwe</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~kasera/">Sneha K. Kasera</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/">Aditya Bhaskara</a> at the University of Utah, and <a href="https://www.propagation.gatech.edu/">Gregory D. Durgin</a> at Georgia Tech.

     Jonathan Decavel-Bueff and Alemayehu Solomon Abrar have created <a href="https://youtu.be/k0Pg27URADk">a video demonstration</a> of their collision prediction system.  The system uses pairwise ultra-wideband (UWB) measurements to repeatedly measure the range between the two objects.  The method extrapolates a few 100 ms into the future based on a parabolic fit of the squared distance over time.  If the extrapolation shows the two will soon be within a threshold distance of each other, it detects an impending collision.  More detail is available in <a href="https://span.engineering.wustl.edu/pub/abrar2020demo.pdf">the abstract</a>.  In the video, the microcontroller turns on an LED.  This demo is part of the <a href="https://ipsn.acm.org/2020/posters.html?v=1">IPSN 2020 poster and demo session</a>. Congrats to Jonathan and Alemayehu for their completed project.

  description: >
     We are recruiting undergraduate researchers to participate in an NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project during Summer 2020 at Washington University in St. Louis.  There are two paid full-time REU positions this summer, both working to develop tools for the Powder wireless platform. <a href="https://powderwireless.net/">Powder</a> enables repeatable experimentation to a degree that has been previously unattainable by researchers.  However, wireless performance is also a function of the real world, for example, weather, season, interference from other wireless systems, exact position of mobile devices, and clock differences at the particular time at which an experiment is run.  Thus another researcher may see different results than the original research.  
     <p>These REU projects will capture meta-data about the conditions of the Powder platform, the devices in the network, and the environment in which an experiment is run, in order to provide a means to be able to debug, after the fact, how different the experimental conditions were compared to those recorded during a prior experiment.  We will develop software tools that can be included in experiments with little set up or overhead from the user.  These tools will be designed to collect metadata, save the metadata, and to compare and visualize the differences between two sets of metadata.  Three categories of these metadata are:</p>
     <ul> <li>Time / clock synchronization: capturing changes in clock offsets between different SDRs in the network</li> <li>Interference power: capturing changes in the noise plus interference power observed at receivers in the network</li> <li>Channel changes: sounding the radio channel using devices alternately as transmitters and receivers to monitor the radio channel for changes in received power that might be attributed to changes in the environment or weather</li> </ul>
     <p>The REU projects will pick some metadata to monitor, determine ways of capturing it during, before and after experiments, and write and test the software tools.  For some of these objectives, we will need to come up with creative ways to accurately capture this data to meet the constraints and limitations of the system.</p>
     <p>Monitoring such metadata with these tools and observing its impact on other research, is a particularly interesting avenue of research that may lead to publication.  Thus writing about the results of the project is also an important task for the REU.  </p>
     <p>The Powder platform is physically deployed in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we will be working with collaborators and other REU students at the University of Utah and at Rice University.  The internship may include one week-long trip to Salt Lake City for in-person work and tutorials at the University of Utah; if so travel expenses will be paid from the REU funding.</p>
     <p>REU participants will be developing software in Python. Other skills of use are: radio wave propagation, statistical signal processing, software radio (particularly GNU Radio), general Linux familiarity. </p>
     <p>To apply, send your CV/resume, transcript, and the names and email addresses of two references to Neal Patwari, first initial lastname @wustl.edu.</p>

    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ossikaltiokallio/">Ossi Kaltiokallio</a> will give a seminar at the ESE Department on Thursday 9 January, 2020, at 9am in the Rodin Auditorium.   <p>Title: RF Sensing and Device-free Localization for Aging in Place</p>  <p>Seminar Abstract: In developed nations, the demographic change in the population is creating many challenges both from a societal and an economic standpoint. Research into aging, age-related conditions, and the means to support an aging population has therefore become a priority for many governments around the world. The aim is to develop both preventive and monitoring systems for aging well at home, in the community, and at work. Radio frequency (RF) sensing is particularly suitable for realizing such monitoring systems because the technology is passive and does not require users to carry obtrusive and uncomfortable sensors, and the technology is suitable for a wide range of monitoring purposes. The focus of this talk is on received signal strength-based device-free localization, which is a subtopic of RF sensing.</p>

      Riku Jäntti returns to the SPAN Lab on 13 May 2019.  He will present a seminar on 'Localization in 5G Ultra–Dense Networks', 3-4 pm on Monday May 13, in Brauer Hall, Room 12.  He is is a Full Professor of Communications Engineering and the head of the department of Communications and Networking at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland. He received his M.Sc (with distinction) in Electrical Engineering in 1997 and D.Sc (with distinction) in Automation and Systems Technology in 2001, both from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK). Prior to joining Aalto (formerly known as TKK) in August 2006, he was professor pro tem at the Department of Computer Science, University of Vaasa. Prof. Jäntti is a senior member of IEEE and associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. He was also IEEE VTS Distinguished Lecturer (Class 2016). The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud-based Radio Access Networks, spectrum and co-existence management, and quantum communications.  Prof. Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Cellular systems are undergoing a transformation towards the fifth generation (5G). Envisioned applications in 5G include intelligent transport system (ITS), autonomous vehicles and robots as part of future roads, factories and society. These applications rely to a great extent on accurate and timely location information of connected devices. This talk proposes a practical scheme for acquiring precise and timely position information by means of a user–centric ultra–dense network (UDN) architecture based on an edge cloud. The considered solution consists of estimating and tracking the azimuth angle–of–arrival (AoA) of the line–of–sight (LoS)–path between a device and multiple transmission–reception points (TRPs), each having a uniform linear antenna array (ULA). AoA estimates from multiple TRPs are fused into position estimates at the edge cloud to obtain timely position information. Extensive measurements have been carried out using a proof–of–concept software–defined–radio (SDR) testbed in order to experimentally assess the achievable positioning accuracy of the proposed architecture. A realistic UDN deployment scenario has been considered in which TRPs consist of antenna arrays mounted on lamp posts. Our results show that practical UDNs can provide sub–meter positioning accuracy of mobile users by employing ULAs with at least four antennas per TRP as well as by taking into account the non–idealities of the ULAs’ phase and magnitude response.

You will need a computer and headset to join the web conference.  This course presents the state-of-the-art in using commercial wireless devices to make radio frequency (RF) channel measurements and sense the state of the environment. RF sensing is used to locate and track people in the vicinity of the RF sensors, to monitor their breathing and pulse rate, to perform gesture and activity recognition, and other applications.  These are often called "device free" sensing because the person being monitored does not carry any device on them, instead, we sense the changes from static deployed wireless network.  This course presents the fundamentals, the statistical models, and the algorithms used in RF sensing.  Students will borrow RF sensors for the semester and implement algorithms that run in real time on the data from their sensors.  We will discuss the most recent research papers in the area via web conference.  Students will implement and improve RF sensing algorithms and be graded in part on their accuracy.  Students will also complete and present a course project to implement or analyze a RF sensing system.

The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control  and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud based Radio Access Networks,  spectrum and co-existence management, quantum communictions and RF Inference.  Riku Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Low power wireless communications has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT).  The performance of the contemporary IoT connectivity solutions are mainly limited by congestion, interference, and limited operation time with battery. These limitations hampers the scaling of the IoT deployments. The first part of the talk discuss Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity solution that combines existing and emerging wireless communication systems, with a new layer of ultra-low-power or passive ambient backscatter communications (AmBC). An AmBC deice modulates the ambient signal impinging at its antenna. In contrast to traditional systems, AmBC devices do not need a power-hungry transceiver and can achieve up to 1000 times lower power consumption  and 10 to 100 times lower device cost than contemporary active-transceiver-based solutions. The second part of talk, discuss the possibility of using quantum radar technology to improve the performance of backscatter communications beyond the limits of classical systems. The proposed quantum backscatter system utilizes microwave quantum illumination to improve the receiver performance. The communication device, the backscatter tag, is still a classical one. All the complexity is put on the transceiver side.

He will present STRAP at the 27th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2018) on 30 July 2018 in Hangzhou China.

       Prof. Chris R. Anderson will present a seminar titled "Integrated Terrain and Clutter Propagation Modeling for 1.7 GHz Spectrum-sharing" on Friday 26 January 2018, from 3:05 - 3:55 PM in WEB 1230. His talk addresses radio propagation measurements and models for the coexistence of military communications systems and future commercial LTE operators in the 1695-2180 MHz band. Existing models were highly conservative in an effort to ensure protection of DoD systems.  Chris' work is an attempt to provide more accurate models so that this band can be fully utilized.
